Overview
This lab explored three modern UI development approaches through hands-on implementation. Using Bootstrap's component-based system, we created a responsive layout featuring a navbar, two-column grid, and pre-styled components like buttons and alerts. The experience highlighted Bootstrap's rapid prototyping capabilities but revealed limitations in customization without CSS overrides. For Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach, we built a responsive card component with image, headline, and CTA button using only utility classes. This demonstrated Tailwind's design flexibility and responsive breakpoints , though  HTML required adaptation. Finally, in React.js, we developed an interactive welcome component with props-driven dynamic content (<WelcomeBanner name="..."/>) and state-managed toggle functionality (useState). This showcased React's declarative advantages over manual DOM manipulation, though the build setup added complexity.

Key Comparisons
Bootstrap excelled in quick, consistent layouts but felt restrictive for custom designs.

Tailwind offered pixel-perfect control through utilities but had a steeper class-naming learning curve.

React streamlined state management and component reuse, albeit with more initial configuration.

Deliverables
Completed implementations include: (1) Bootstrap's navbar and grid system, (2) Tailwind's responsive card with hover effects, and (3) React's toggleable specials component. The project reinforced core differences between utility-first (Tailwind) and component-based (Bootstrap/React) paradigms, particularly in workflow and customization trade-offs.
